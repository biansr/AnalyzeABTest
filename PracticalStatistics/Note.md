## 1. Descriptive statistics

### Measures of Spread 
1.	Range MAX-MIN
2.	Interquartile Range (IQR) Q3-Q1
3.	Standard Deviation
4.	Variance

### measures of Center
1.	Means
2.	Medians
3.	Modes

### Shape
1. Right-skewed
2. Left-skewed
3. Symmetric

### Outlier
1. Noting they exist and the impact on summary statistics.
2. If typo - remove or fix
3. Understanding why they exist, and the impact on questions we are trying to answer about our data.
4. Reporting the 5 number summary values is often a better indication than measures like the mean and standard deviation when we have outliers.
5. Be careful in reporting. Know how to ask the right questions.

### Useful ways to describe data
1. five number summary
2. histogram, box plot

## 2. Conditional probability and bayes rule

## 3. Normal distribution
A sampling distribution is the distribution of a statistic. 
1.	The sampling distribution is centered on the original parameter value.
2.	The sampling distribution decreases its variance depending on the sample size used. 


Two important mathematical theorems for working with sampling distributions include:
1.	Law of Large Numbers: The Law of Large Numbers says that as our sample size increases, the sample mean gets closer to the population mean
2.	Central Limit Theorem: The Central Limit Theorem states that with a large enough sample size the sampling distribution of the mean will be normally distributed.

**Bootstrapping** is sampling with replacement. Using random.choice in python actually samples in this way.

## 4. Confident interval
