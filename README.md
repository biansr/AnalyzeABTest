# Analyze A/B Test Results

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. This Repository contains the course project from Udacity where an A/B test has been analyzed.   
   
This A/B test is run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal of the project is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.  
  
In the analysis, I used two methods: statistical test and logistic regression, to evaluate whether or not the company should implement the new page. Both results suggested that the company should not implement the new page.
